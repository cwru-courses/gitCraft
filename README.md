# gitCraft
## Summer 2024 CSDS393 Group 2 project

A central location for handmade crafters to gather, to share and inspire others, and to be creative with other projects as a springboard

gitCraft is an app for sharing craft projects with the user community, with the ability to copy, or "fork", other posts into a private collection, where they are free to edit the project with personal customizations. When a project is completed, the user can create a post to submit to the community feed.
